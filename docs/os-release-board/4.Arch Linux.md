## Preview1
- **Build:** preview1-20221219

### Release note

**Hightlight**
Initial release of Arch Linux port for Fydetab Duo.
Useful things to note:

- Default login credentials: ```alarm/root```: ```alarm```
- Using [iwd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/iwd) to connect to the internet:
- This release of Arch Linux does not bundle with a default Desktop Environment, if you want one, you need to install it yourself


**Known issues**
It's still in the early porting stage; the following features are still under development:

- Desktop Environment UI is still software rendering, hardware acceleration is unavailable

### Tutorial: Installing KDE Plasma Desktop
This is an initial Test installation guide

in this tutorial, some basic steps are covered in order to
* connect to wifi

#### flash image under Linux
assuming
* the fydetab_duo is connected in and in loader mode (see https://wiki.fydetabduo.com/flashing_the_fydetab_duo)
* the upgrade_tool is located under ./foundation-rk3588/rk3588-image-maker/Linux_Upgrade_Tool/upgrade_tool and
* the _sha256sum validated_ _extracted_ & fydetab_duo-archlinux-update-20221219.img image is in the current folder:

> sudo ./foundation-rk3588/rk3588-image-maker/Linux_Upgrade_Tool/upgrade_tool uf ./fydetab_duo-archlinux-update-20221219.img

Warning: serius neck stiffness possible as the tty is _not_ rotateable with
> echo 3 > /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate_all

login:
 root / alarm
double your tty font size

> setfont -d

#### setup your wifi / wlan0, 

following the instructions under https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd
start by adding some required configuration details

`nano /etc/iwd/main.conf`

insert
```
[General]
EnableNetworkConfiguration=true
[Network]
EnableIPv6=true
```
remark: change `EnableIPv6=false` if you don't have / want ipv6

next, you need to enable iwd network service with

`systemctl enable --now iwd`

now you can edit the connection details with the tool

`iwctl`

First, if you do not know your wireless device _name_, list all Wi-Fi devices:

`[iwd]# device list`

If the device or its corresponding adapter is turned off, turn it on:

`[iwd]# device name set-property Powered on`

`[iwd]# adapter adapter set-property Powered on`

Then, to initiate a scan for networks (note that this command will not output anything):

`[iwd]# station name scan`

You can then list all available networks:

`[iwd]# station name get-networks`

Finally, to connect to a network:

`[iwd]# station name connect SSID`

you can check if your wlan0 device now has an IP address via

`ip --brief address show`

Hint: now you should be able to access also via ssh...

#### resize the root partition 

In this tutorial, only one root partition is available and used, and the partition is limited to 12 GB.

increase size of root partition to the available space (12gb), as the image comes with only 2gb available space preconfigured

> resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p1

#### install updates
adapt sources.list
`nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`

select a fitting mirror near your location

update with the arch pacage manager pacman

`pacman -Syyu`

accept the defaults here on prompt. during the update, a lot of kernel related files will be warned about, as they cannot be found and are very likely _not_ part of the arch installation (...supplied via image, kernel 5.10 is installed)
check kernel via

`uname -a`
` Linux alarm 5.10.110-fyde #145 SMP Mon Dec 19 07:00:43 UTC 2022 aarch64 GNU/Linux`

reboot

`shutdown -r 0`

#### Install KDE Plasma
following https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KDE ... in July 2024, this will install plasma 6.1

install kde plasme, display manager & kscreen for display adjustment, bluetooth and packagekit for "discover" software management integration:

> pacman -S sddm sddm-kcm kscreen bluez bluez-utils packagekit

... start and enable sddm & bluetooth:

> systemctl enable --now sddm bluetooth

... a reboot may be required as well

you will now be greeted by the plasma sddm aka login screen (still rotated to the left)

currently, you have to select X11, as wayland will only show a black screen.

once you logged in (initial password `alarm`), you can adjust the plasma desktop settings to rotate.

Additional software can now be installed via discover.

##### TODO
as this is a _very limited_ environment still, some things need to be done, both for the user, and on the Hardware support, wich is limited by the shipped linux kernel.
* partitioning: _only_ 2 GB root partition, resized to 12... additional partitioning required & files need moving
* rotate tty & SDDM login screen
* replace iwd
* preselect X11 for plasma session - wayland does not run yet
* Hardware: bluetooth & camera don't work -> kernel build + kernel modules for bluetooth, but how?
* Hardware: display  is _only software rendering supported_ -> kernel build + kernel modules for bluetooth, but how?
* Hardware: other hardware e.g. accelerometer, NPU ...
