Fydetab Duo is designed to run FydeOS by default. However, you may also boot and run other open-source operating systems.


## Factory default OS: FydeOS quick start

When you first press the power on button on your Fydetab Duo and boot it up for the first time, you will be greeted by FydeOS.

On the first boot, FydeOS will initiate what is usually called the "out-of-box experience" - a fancy way of saying "activation wizard". During OOBE, it will ask for certain information such as your language, keyboard layout, wifi details, user account details and credentials. Most of these should be self-explanatory.

It's worth mentioning that you can choose from using a FydeOS account, a Google account or a completely offline "local account" to continue using FydeOS. If you have yet to have a FydeOS account or a Google account, you are also given the option to create one right on the page. Using an online account with FydeOS will enable extra cloud-powered functionalities, for example, profile and preferences synchronisation.

Once you are landed on the desktop, you can start your journey by launching the "browser" app to access your favourite web apps. FydeOS will also prompt you to activate the "Android subsystem" by sending you a system notification; if you follow the instructions and accept the Terms, you can utilise the built-in Android support to run thousands of Android apps. Do check out the FydeOS Store; it's a good starting point to install some of the essentials.

If you know your way around the Linux command line, you can also enable the Linux subsystem within FyedOS to utilise a fully self-contained Debian 11 environment. You can find it under the "FydeOS settings" - "Developer" tab.

It's recommended to familiarise yourself with the https://fydeos.io/help website, and I am sure the contents will help you navigate through the daily usage of FydeOS.
