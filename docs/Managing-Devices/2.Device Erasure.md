# Device Erasure

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on securely erasing your device using both the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line interface (CLI). By following these methods, you can ensure that your personal data is thoroughly removed. During the device erasure process, all user data will be permanently deleted, and the device will be restored to its factory settings. Before proceeding, it is essential to back up all important files.

## Graphical Erasure

1. Access the "Settings" Menu

Begin by locating and clicking on the "Settings" icon on your device's main screen. This will open the settings menu. In the settings menu, navigate to the "Advanced" section to reveal additional advanced settings options.

2. Enter the "Reset Settings" Section

Within the "Advanced" settings section, find and select the "Reset settings" option. This will direct you to the interface dedicated to device reset.

3. Locate the Powerwash Setting

Within the "Reset settings" interface, locate and click on the "Powerwash" option. Next, click the "Reset" button. A confirmation prompt will appear, asking you to confirm your choice. Please note that this action is irreversible, so ensure that you have backed up all important data before proceeding.

4. Restart the Device

After confirming the erasure operation, click the "Restart" button. The device will automatically restart and initiate the data erasure process.

5. Wait for Device Restart and Login

Once the erasure process is complete, the device will automatically restart. On the startup screen, enter your account credentials (username and password) to log in.

6. Reset the Device

Once you have successfully logged into the device, navigate to the "Settings" menu and locate the "Powerwash" button. Click on it to trigger the device reset process, restoring the device to its factory settings.

Please allow some time for the device to complete the erasure process. Once finished, your device will be restored to its original factory settings. The system will automatically clear the data and guide you through the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) phase after the restart.

## Command Line Erasure

1. Access crosh

Launch the Chromium browser within the FydeOS graphical interface and simultaneously press the `Ctrl+Alt+t` keys. On certain computers, such as Apple Mac, you may need to press `Fn+Ctrl+Alt+t`. This action will open a new tab called "crosh."

2. Enter bash

In the opened "crosh" tab, type the following command:

```
shell
```

After executing the command, the prompt should display:

```
chronos@localhost / $
```

3. Obtain Root Privileges

To gain root privileges, enter the following command:

```
sudo su -
```

Please note that starting from FydeOS for PC v6.0, the default password for the system command-line user "chronos" is no longer set. You can directly use the `sudo` command to execute command-line operations that require root privileges. If you need to change the password, please refer to [this document](https://fydeos.com/help/knowledge-base/recipes/chronos-password).

4. Execute the Commands

Enter the following commands to initiate the erasure process:

```
sudo clobber
sudo reboot
```

After the system restarts, it will automatically clear the data and guide you through the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) phase.# Device Erasure
