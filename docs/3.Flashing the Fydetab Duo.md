title: ⚡️ Flashing the Fydetab Duo
---

Here is a step-by-step guide for flashing a new OS onto your Fydetab Duo.

## To make Fydetab Duo boot into Loader Mode

### 1. Prepare Your Device

- Connect your Fydetab Duo to the computer you'll use for the OS flash.
  >Due to an oversight by our factory supplier, the Type-C cable that comes with the fydetab doesn’t support data transfer, so you won’t be able to get into Loader mode with it. Please use a different Type-C cable that can handle data transfers.
- Ensure the device is powered off before proceeding. If it powers on automatically, turn it off again to avoid unintended operations.

### 2. Enter Loader/Maskrom Mode

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the volume up (vol+) button.
- **Step 2:** While holding the vol+ button, briefly press the power button for 0.5 to 1 second.
- **Step 3:** Release both buttons simultaneously to Enter `Loader Mode`(Note: If releasing the buttons simultaneously does not work, it is better to release the power button and afterwards the vol+ button).
- **Step 4(Windows Ony):** Use RockdevTool(metioned blow) to switch to `Maskrom Mode`

### 3. Check the Status

- If successful, your flashing device should be able to connect to the Fydetab Duo.The device’s LED will remain off, and the screen will stay completely dark.
- Occasionally, the screen may display an image indicating that the device is in Loader Mode. Note that this image may not always appear due to display issues.

### 4. Enter Maskrom mode in case of brick

If for some reason an unsupported image has been flashed or something has been corrupted making it impossible to access Loader/Maskrom mode with the button combination explained in step 2, there is the possibility to use the Maskrom button on the Fydetab's PCB.

- Force a shutdown by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds.
- Press and hold MASKROM mode button from the PCB. While holding down the button connect the USB from the tablet to the PC.
- Open the flashing tool from the next section and you will see that a device is detected in MASKROM mode.
