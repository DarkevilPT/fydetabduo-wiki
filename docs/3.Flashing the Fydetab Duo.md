title: ⚡️Flashing the Fydetab Duo
---

Here is a step-by-step guide for flashing a new OS onto your Fydetab Duo.

## To make Fydetab Duo boot into "maskrom" mode
- Connect your Fydetab Duo to a computer that you intend to use to perform the OS flash, then power off your Fydetab Duo.
- Press the volume up button and hold it, then press the power button to power up the device.
- Keep holding the volume up button until you see the screen lit up but displays nothing.
- Your Fydetab Duo should boot into "maskrom" mode where you should see the screen lit up but displays nothing.
- It's all about timing; if your Fydetab Duo accidentally boots into an OS, you can repeat the process until it reaches the "maskrom" mode.
